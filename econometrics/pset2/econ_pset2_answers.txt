PROBLEM SET 2 — Questions with Answers

Question 1.1) 
mean = 201.476, variance = 42124.075
Question 1.2) 
mean_10 = 172.461, mean_25 = 187.637, mean_100 = 200.254; closest: n=100
Question 1.3) 
avg(sample mean, n=2) = 198.826; avg(sample mean, n=500) = 201.257. The n=2 distribution is wider/less normal; n=500 is tighter and approximately normal (CLT).
