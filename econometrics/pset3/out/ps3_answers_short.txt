Q1.1: Visual correlation appears negative (Pearson r = -0.547).
Q1.2: α̂ = 589.46, β̂ = -2.251. α̂ is at 0°F (off-support); β̂ is points per 1°F.
Q1.3: Residual variance differs across temperature bins ⇒ use robust SEs alongside classical SEs.
Q1.4(a): t (β=0) = -9.879.
Q1.4(b): t (β=-1.85) = -1.76.
Q1.5: ΔTemp = −2.35°F ⇒ Δ(math) = β̂ × (−2.35) = 5.29 points.
Q1.6: β̂ unlikely causal due to omitted variables and aggregation issues.
Q2.1: β̂₁ (fees) = 73.025, robust SE = 9.31.
Q2.2: corr(units, fees) = 0.711, corr(units, construction_cost) = 0.675.
Q2.3: β̂₂ (fees) = 63.098, θ̂₂ (units) = 20260.846.
Q2.4: β̂₃ (fees) = 48.15.
Q2.5: α̂₃ = -137561.07 (off-support). new_brunswick coef = 47630.464.
